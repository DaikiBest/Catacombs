# My Personal Project

## Proposal

This program will be a desktop RPG adventure video game inspired by the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. The game's premise is a room-by-room progression in linear order where each room holds a random encounter (enemy, loot, or shop). The player must survive and thrive in these encounters – increasing their player's power by gathering items and gold – ultimately to defeat a final (stronger) enemy. 
This project is of interest to me as I enjoy playing video games. I would like to apply the game design knowledge that I have aquired over the years to develop my own video game.

The intended user:
- enjoys adventure games and a medieval setting (likes general role-playing and RPG games).
- does not mind randomizers in games.
- would like a short experience that can be finished within a few minutes.
