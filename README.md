# My Personal Project

## Proposal

This program will be a desktop RPG adventure video game inspired by the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. The game's premise is a room-by-room progression in linear order where each room holds a random encounter (enemy, loot, or shop). The player must survive and thrive in these encounters – increasing their player's power by gathering items and gold – ultimately to defeat a final (stronger) enemy. 
This project is of interest to me as I enjoy playing video games. I would like to apply the game design knowledge that I have aquired over the years to develop my own video game.

The intended user:
- enjoys adventure games and a medieval setting (likes general role-playing and RPG games).
- does not mind randomizers in games.
- would like a short experience that can be finished within a few minutes.

User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to store my items (weapons, armor and coins) in my inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of my items.
- As a user, I want to be able to combat enemies by rolling a random dice.
- As a user, I want to be able to view relevant information to the encounter (eg. my and the enemy’s health and damage during a combat encounter).
- As a user, I want to be able to purchase items using gold accumulated throughout encounters.
- As a user, I want to be able to sell items of my choice for gold.
- As a user, I want the game to end when your health drops to zero, and win when you defeat the final (boss) enemy.
- As a user, I want to be able to have the option save my current game (reminder) when quitting the app.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my game from a file, in order to continue the game where I left off last time.
